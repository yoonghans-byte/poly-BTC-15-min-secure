## 📖 Overview

A production-grade, modular trading system for [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com) prediction markets. Run **7 concurrent strategies** — from cross-market arbitrage to AI-driven forecasting — each isolated in its own wallet with independent capital, risk limits, and execution modes (LIVE or PAPER).

The platform includes an enterprise-level **whale tracking engine** that auto-discovers profitable traders, scores them with regime-adaptive algorithms, detects coordinated whale clusters, and lets you simulate copy-trading their moves — all from a beautiful real-time dashboard.

### Why This Bot?

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Manual trading is slow & emotional | 7 automated strategies scan 24/7, execute in milliseconds |
| Can't find alpha in prediction markets | Whale scanner discovers profitable traders with proven track records |
| Risk of ruin from a single bad trade | Per-wallet isolation, daily loss limits, global kill switch |
| No visibility into what the bot is doing | Real-time SSE dashboard with live trades, P&L, positions |
| Rate-limited by Polymarket APIs | Multi-API pool with rotation, 16x parallel scanning |
| Fear of losing real money while testing | Paper trading mode by default — no real funds at risk |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ ([download](https://nodejs.org/))
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Git** ([download](https://git-scm.com/))

> **Need more help installing these?** See the [Setup Guide](SETUP_GUIDE.md#step-1-install-the-prerequisites) for detailed OS-specific instructions.

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dylanpersonguy/Polymarket-Trading-Bot.git
cd Polymarket-Trading-Bot

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Set up your environment file
cp .env.example .env
```

> **Windows users:** Use `copy .env.example .env` instead of `cp`.

### Launch (Paper Trading — Safe by Default)

```bash
# Start the bot with default config (all wallets in PAPER mode)
npm start
```

No `.env` changes needed for paper trading — it works out of the box with fake money.

The bot will start all 10 wallets (8 strategies), launch the whale scanner, and serve the dashboard at:

> **🌐 Dashboard: [http://localhost:3000/dashboard](http://localhost:3000/dashboard)**

### Verify It's Working

```bash
# Check the dashboard
open http://localhost:3000/dashboard

# View engine status via API
curl http://localhost:3000/api/data | jq

# List all wallets
curl http://localhost:3000/api/wallets | jq

# View live trades
curl http://localhost:3000/api/trades/all | jq
```

## 🧠 Strategies

### 1. Cross-Market Arbitrage

Identifies price discrepancies between correlated Polymarket markets and captures the spread.

```yaml
strategy_config:
  cross_market_arbitrage:
    min_edge: 0.03  # Minimum 3% edge to trade
```

**Example:** Market A prices "Trump wins" at 52¢ while Market B prices "Trump nominee" at 48¢. If logically linked, the bot captures the 4% spread.

### 2. Mispricing Arbitrage

Detects when a market's outcome probabilities don't sum to 100% (minus the vig), indicating mispricing.

```yaml
strategy_config:
  mispricing_arbitrage:
    min_dislocation: 0.02  # 2% minimum dislocation
```

**Example:** A binary market shows YES at 55¢ and NO at 42¢ (total = 97¢). The bot buys the underpriced side.

### 3. Filtered High-Probability Convergence

The flagship strategy. A rule-based, no-AI approach that targets markets where the leading outcome has a 65-96% probability AND passes 7 strict filters:

| Filter | What It Checks |
|--------|---------------|
| Liquidity | ≥ $10K market liquidity + depth within 1% of mid |
| Probability Band | Leading outcome between 65% and 96% |
| Spread | Bid-ask spread ≤ 200 bps |
| Time-to-Resolution | Market resolves within 14 days |
| Anti-Chasing | No recent 8%+ price spikes |
| Flow/Pressure | Orderbook imbalance or net buy flow ≥ $500 |
| Cluster Exposure | ≤ 25% capital in correlated markets |

**Sizing:** `position = capital × 0.5% × setup_score` where setup_score is a composite of spread tightness (30%), depth (25%), order flow (25%), and time-to-resolution (20%).

**Example:** Market "Will inflation drop below 3%?" — probability at 78%, spread at 120 bps, $50K liquidity, resolves in 9 days, strong buy flow. Setup score = 0.82. On $10K capital: position = $10,000 × 0.005 × 0.82 = **$41 entry**, targeting **200 bps ($0.82) profit**.

### 4. Market Making (Spread Strategy)

Quotes both sides of the orderbook, capturing the bid-ask spread. Works best in liquid, stable markets.

```yaml
strategy_config:
  market_making:
    spread_bps: 40  # 40 bps spread target
```

**Example:** Quoting 72¢ bid / 72.4¢ ask on a high-volume market, capturing 0.4¢ per round-trip.

### 5. Momentum

Rides short-term price trends using a 15-minute lookback window.

```yaml
strategy_config:
  momentum:
    lookback_minutes: 15
```

**Example:** Detects a market moving from 45¢ → 52¢ in 15 minutes with increasing volume. Enters a BUY, riding the momentum.

### 6. AI Forecast

ML-driven strategy that combines web research with quantitative analysis to forecast market outcomes.

```yaml
strategy_config:
  ai_forecast:
    refresh_minutes: 30  # Re-analyze every 30 minutes
```

### 7. Copy Trading

Mirrors trades from configured whale addresses in near-real-time with comprehensive risk management. Supports multiple whales, three sizing modes, and automatic exit when the whale closes their position.

**Key Features:**
- **Multi-whale following** — Track any number of wallet addresses simultaneously
- **Mirror / Inverse modes** — Copy whales directly or trade against them (contrarian)
- **3 sizing modes** — Fixed size, proportional to whale's trade, or half-Kelly
- **Full exit management** — Take profit, stop loss, trailing stop, time exit, whale-exit mirroring
- **Per-whale performance tracking** — Win rate, P&L, and consecutive loss cooldowns
- **Drawdown circuit breaker** — Auto-pauses copy trading when drawdown limit hit
- **Daily volume caps** — Prevents over-exposure from high-frequency whales
- **Market blacklist/whitelist** — Fine-grained control over which markets to copy

```yaml
strategy_config:
  copy_trade:
    whale_addresses:
      - "0xYourWhaleAddressHere"
    copy_mode: mirror              # mirror | inverse
    size_mode: fixed               # fixed | proportional | kelly
    fixed_size: 10
    max_open_positions: 15
    take_profit_bps: 150
    stop_loss_bps: 100
    trailing_stop_activate_bps: 80
    exit_on_whale_exit: true
    max_drawdown_pct: 0.15
    max_daily_volume_usd: 5000
```

### 8. User-Defined Strategy

A template for building your own custom strategy. Extend the `BaseStrategy` class:

```typescript
// src/strategies/custom/user_defined_strategy.ts
export class UserDefinedStrategy extends BaseStrategy {
  async evaluate(market: MarketData): Promise<Signal | null> {
    // Your custom logic here
  }
}
```

## 🐋 Whale Tracking & Scanner

The whale tracking engine is a self-contained system that discovers, scores, and monitors profitable Polymarket traders.

### How It Works

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│  Market Scanner  │────▶│  Trade Analyzer   │────▶│  Whale Scorer   │
│  50 markets/cycle│     │  Volume + Win Rate│     │  6-dimension    │

│  Top 5 markets   │     │  market = cluster │     │  slippage model │
└─────────────────┘     └──────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

### Scanner Configuration

```yaml
whale_tracking:
  scanner:
    enabled: true
    scanIntervalMs: 600000           # Scan every 10 minutes
    marketsPerScan: 50               # Top 50 liquid markets
    parallelFetchBatch: 16           # 16 concurrent fetches
    minMarketVolume24hUsd: 10000     # Skip low-volume markets
    autoPromoteEnabled: true         # Auto-track high-scoring whales
    autoPromoteMinScore: 60          # Minimum score to auto-track
    clusterDetectionEnabled: true    # Detect whale herds
    networkGraphEnabled: true        # Map whale relationships
    copySimEnabled: true             # Simulate copy trading
    regimeAdaptiveEnabled: true      # Adjust scores by regime
```

### Scoring System

Each whale is scored on 6 dimensions:

| Dimension | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Profitability | 30% | Historical P&L and ROI |
| Timing Skill | 20% | Entry/exit timing relative to price moves |
| Low Slippage | 15% | Execution quality and market impact |
| Consistency | 15% | Win rate stability over time |
| Market Selection | 10% | Quality of markets chosen |
| Recency/Activeness | 10% | Recent trading activity |

### API Pool (Rate Limit Bypass)

Distribute API requests across multiple endpoints to multiply throughput:

```yaml
whale_tracking:
  scanner:
    apiPool:
      enabled: true
      selectionStrategy: least-loaded  # round-robin | least-loaded | weighted-random
      endpoints:
        - name: custom-proxy
          url: https://your-proxy.example.com
          type: data-api
          maxRequestsPerMinute: 60
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

All configuration lives in `config.yaml`. Here's the structure:

### Environment

```yaml
environment:
  enable_live_trading: false  # PAPER mode by default — safety first
```

### Wallets

```yaml
wallets:
  - id: paper_convergence
    mode: PAPER                  # PAPER or LIVE
    strategy: filtered_high_prob_convergence
    capital: 10000               # $10,000 starting capital
    risk_limits:
      max_position_size: 500     # Max $500 per position
      max_exposure_per_market: 1000
      max_daily_loss: 500        # Stop at $500 daily loss
      max_open_trades: 50
      max_drawdown: 0.10         # 10% max drawdown
```

---

## 📁 .env File Setup

The `.env` file stores your private settings (API keys, trading mode). It is **never uploaded to GitHub** — it's in `.gitignore`.

### Create your .env file

```bash
cp .env.example .env       # Mac/Linux
copy .env.example .env     # Windows
```

### What's inside

| Variable | Required? | Default | Description |
|----------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `ENABLE_LIVE_TRADING` | For live trading | `false` | Set to `true` to allow real trades |
| `POLYMARKET_API_KEY` | For live trading | *(empty)* | Your Polymarket API key |
| `DASHBOARD_PORT` | No | `3000` | Which port the dashboard runs on |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | No | `info` | Logging detail: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |

### Example .env for paper trading (no changes needed):

```env
ENABLE_LIVE_TRADING=false
POLYMARKET_API_KEY=
DASHBOARD_PORT=3000
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

### Example .env for live trading:

```env
ENABLE_LIVE_TRADING=true
POLYMARKET_API_KEY=your_api_key_from_polymarket
DASHBOARD_PORT=3000
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

> The `.env.example` file is included in the repo as a template. Copy it to `.env` and fill in your values.

---

## 📊 Paper vs Live Trading

### Paper Trading (Default — No Real Money)

Paper trading simulates trades with fake money. **This is the default.** Just run:

```bash
npm start
```

All wallets start in PAPER mode. You can test every strategy safely.

### Live Trading (Real Money)

Live trading requires **two safety switches** to both be enabled — this prevents accidentally trading with real money:

| Switch | Where | What to set |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Switch 1** | `.env` file | `ENABLE_LIVE_TRADING=true` |
| **Switch 2** | `config.yaml` | `enable_live_trading: true` |

**Both must be `true`** for live trading to work. If either is `false`, all wallets run in paper mode.

### Step-by-step to go live:

**1. Get your Polymarket API key:**
- Log in to [polymarket.com](https://polymarket.com)
- Go to Settings → API Keys
- Create and copy your key

**2. Edit your `.env` file:**
```env
ENABLE_LIVE_TRADING=true
POLYMARKET_API_KEY=paste_your_key_here
```

**3. Edit `config.yaml`:**
```yaml
environment:
  enable_live_trading: true

wallets:
  - id: my_live_wallet
    mode: LIVE                    # ← Must be LIVE, not PAPER
    strategy: filtered_high_prob_convergence
    capital: 100                  # Start small!
    risk_limits:
      max_position_size: 20
      max_exposure_per_market: 50
      max_daily_loss: 25
      max_open_trades: 5
      max_drawdown: 0.15
```

**4. Start the bot:**
```bash
npm start
```

### Safety Features (Always Active)

| Protection | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Two-factor enable | Both `.env` AND `config.yaml` must enable live trading |
| API key check | LIVE orders are refused if `POLYMARKET_API_KEY` is missing |
| Daily loss limit | Trading pauses when daily losses hit your `max_daily_loss` |
| Max drawdown | Trading stops if total loss exceeds your `max_drawdown` |
| Per-trade cap | No trade exceeds `max_position_size` |
| Rate limiting | LIVE mode: 20 orders/min (Paper: 120/min) |
| Kill switch | Emergency stop via dashboard |

> ⚠️ **Start with paper trading for at least a few days** before going live. Start with small amounts ($50–$100) when you switch to live.

---

### Enabling LIVE Trading

See the [Paper vs Live Trading](#-paper-vs-live-trading) section above for full instructions.

```bash
# Quick version: set both .env and config.yaml, then run
npm start
```

> ⚠️ **Warning:** LIVE mode executes real trades with real funds. Start with PAPER mode to validate your strategy first.

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Wallet isolation** — Each strategy operates in a sandboxed wallet
- **Event-driven** — SSE for dashboard, signal-based execution
- **Pluggable strategies** — Extend `BaseStrategy` for custom logic
- **Paper-first** — Everything defaults to simulation mode
- **Zero external services** — SQLite, no Redis/Postgres/RabbitMQ required
